## WordPress My Photo Buckets Plugin
**Description**
* Designed a custom WordPress plugin using the WordPress API.
* Optimized the plugin for scalability with lazy loading and accessibility with [WCAG 2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance) compliance.
* Integrated the fancybox.js library.
* Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions for custom-styled photo albums. Seamlessly integrated with [WordPressâ€™s built-in gallery](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/media/galleries/) creation feature. Image captions can be edited through the standard media library image viewer; the plugin will automatically display it in the album page below the photo and with Fancybox's `data-caption` attribute.
* WordPress admin can update the album featured image and category description within the single album editing page.
* To view the main album directory frontend, one can visit the slug `/photo_album`. Each album box links to it's own permalink with the slug `/photo_album/name-of-your-album`.
* The photo album directory alone can be deployed anywhere with the shortcode `[album_shortcode]`.
